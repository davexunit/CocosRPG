* Add common loading interface for actors loaded from xml or from sqlite
    database
* Fix memory leaks from map scenes
    - When a new map scene is loaded it appears that there are still some
      dangling references to old scenes. These need to be tracked down and
      removed.
    - THIS IS A BUG IN COCOS2D - BUG REPORT SUBMITTED
* Add game loading/saving with SQLite database
    - Changes to db schema (add/remove tables) are updated automatically in
      the db but insertions and deletions only affect the db in memory, not
      until commit() is called will the changes saved. This makes sqlite
      perfect for game saves.
    - Construct database schema
* Document more code
    - Ongoing process. The main classes are decently documented.
* Add dialog system
    - Do some research
* Add HUD and other needed UI elements
    - cocos built in menu class won't cut it
* Add cinematic scripting
    - Probably really difficult
* Work on battle engine
    - Vague as hell
