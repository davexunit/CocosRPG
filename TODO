* Fix memory leaks from map scenes'
    - When a new map scene is loaded it appears that there are still some
      dangling references to old scenes. These need to be tracked down and
      removed.
* Fix transitions between map scenes not working
    - State doesn't appear to be correctly saved. MapScene may have to take all
      necessary parameters in its __init__ method in order to work properly
* Document more code
    - Ongoing process. The main classes are decently documented.
* Add game loading/saving with SQLite database
    - Any way to keep a db completely in memory and then write only when player
      saves game?
* Add dialog system
    - Do some research
* Add HUD and other needed UI elements
    - cocos built in menu class won't cut it
* Add cinematic scripting
    - Probably really difficult
* Work on battle engine
    - Vague as hell
