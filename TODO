* Add cinematic scripting
    - Probably really difficult
    - Dialog system
    - Character movements, etc.
* Work on battle engine
    - Vague as hell
* Document more code
    - Ongoing process. The main classes are decently documented.
* Add HUD and other needed UI elements
    - cocos built in menu class won't cut it
* Fix memory leaks from map scenes
    - When a new map scene is loaded it appears that there are still some
      dangling references to old scenes. These need to be tracked down and
      removed.
    - THIS IS A BUG IN COCOS2D - BUG REPORT SUBMITTED
